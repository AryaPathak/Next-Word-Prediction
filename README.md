**Next Word Prediction Model**
Overview
This project implements a next-word prediction model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers. The model is trained on the text from the Project Gutenberg eBook "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" (text file 1661-0.txt). The goal is to predict the next word in a given sequence of words based on the patterns learned from the training data.

Problem Statement
In natural language processing, one common task is to predict the next word in a sentence or phrase, which can enhance various applications like text completion, chatbots, and writing assistants. This model addresses that problem by leveraging deep learning techniques to understand and generate human-like text.

Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
TensorFlow (with Keras)
Matplotlib
Pickle
Usage
Load the Dataset: The model uses the text from the specified file (e.g., '1661-0.txt'). 

Feature Engineering: The text data is tokenized into words, and input-output pairs are generated based on the specified WORD_LENGTH, which determines how many previous words are used to predict the next word.

Model Training: The RNN is built and trained using the prepared input data. The training includes validation and saves the model and training history for future use.

Next Word Prediction: After training, the model can predict the next word based on a provided text sequence. You can use the predict_completions function with any input sequence to generate word predictions.

Example
You can use the following quotes to test the model:

python
Copy code
quotes = [
    "It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages.",
    "That which does not kill us makes us stronger.",
    "I'm not upset that you lied to me, I'm upset that from now on I can't believe you.",
    "And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music.",
    "It is hard enough to remember my opinions, without also remembering my reasons for them!"
]
Conclusion
This next-word prediction model showcases the application of LSTM networks in natural language processing. It serves as a foundation for developing more sophisticated text generation and completion systems. Further improvements can include training on larger datasets and tuning hyperparameters for better performance.
